[Binary operation bopit game with FPGA](https://github.com/brutatoasta/bitop)

Very proud of this game which is handheld unlike many other projects which are the size of arcade cabinets! The setting was toys for orphans so I pushed my team to make a realistic handheld toy instead of a giant cabinet that children wouldnt have space for... My main contribution is I soldered everything and debugged the hardware.
