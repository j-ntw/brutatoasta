A cute clothes sorting and outfit styling app. I worked on the cloud storage, authentication features using the Firebase API and Java.


[Binary operation bopit game with FPGA](https://github.com/j-ntw/bitop)

Very proud of this game which is handheld unlike many other projects which are the size of arcade cabinets! The setting was toys for orphans so I pushed my team to make a realistic handheld toy instead of a giant cabinet that children wouldnt have space for... My main contribution is I soldered everything and debugged the hardware.
